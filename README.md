#### *Created an interactive dashboard to display bacteria living inside the human body per each subject individual selected using Plotly.js and HTML/CSS. Then deploy the dashboad to a cloud server*

## Project Overview
This project consisted of taking a sample of hundreds of people and creating a dashboard that displayed information about bacteria that live inside the human's belly button. The dashboard then allows the user to visualize each person's demographic information, top 10 bacteria found, how frequently they wash their belly button, and the bacteria cultures per sample.
